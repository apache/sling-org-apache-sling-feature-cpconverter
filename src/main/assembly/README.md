## Installation

### Windows 2000/XP

  1) Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. `${project.build.finalName}.zip` to the directory you wish to install `${project.name} ${project.version}`.
These instructions assume you chose `C:\Program Files`.
The subdirectory `${project.build.finalName}` will be created from the archive.

  2) Add the `SFA_HOME` environment variable by opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause), selecting the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button, then adding the `SFA_HOME` variable in the user variables with the value `C:\Program Files\${project.build.finalName}`.

  3) In the same dialog, add the SFA environment variable in the user variables with the value `%SFA_HOME%\bin`.

  4) In the same dialog, update/create the _Path_ environment variable in the user variables and prepend the value `%SFA%` to add `${project.name}` available in the command line.

  5) In the same dialog, make sure that `JAVA_HOME` exists in your user variables or in the system variables and it is set to the location of your JDK, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\1.8.0_152` and that `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` is in your _Path_ environment variable.

  6) Open a new command prompt (Winkey + R then type cmd) and run `sfa --version` to verify that it is correctly installed.

## Unix-based Operating Systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)

  1) Extract the distribution archive, i.e. `${project.build.finalName}.tar.gz` to the directory you wish to install `${project.name} ${project.version}`.
These instructions assume you chose `/usr/local`.
The subdirectory `${project.build.finalName}` will be created from the archive.

  2) In a command terminal, add the `SFA_HOME` environment variable, e.g.
        `export SFA_HOME=/usr/local/${project.build.finalName}`.

  3) Add the `SFA` environment variable, e.g. `export SFA=$SFA_HOME/bin`.

  4) Add `SFA` environment variable to your path, e.g. `export PATH=$SFA:$PATH`.

  5) Make sure that `JAVA_HOME` is set to the location of your JDK, e.g. `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/1.8.0_152` and that `$JAVA_HOME/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.

  6) Run `sfa --version` to verify that it is correctly installed.

  Open the shell and type `cp2fm -h` to see the available commands:

```
$ ./cp2fm -h
Usage: cp2fm [-hmqsvX] [-b=<bundlesStartOrder>] -c=<contentPackage>
             -o=<outputDirectory> [-f=<filteringPatterns>]...
Apache Sling Content Package to Sling Feature converter

  -c, --content-package=<contentPackage>
                            The content-package input file.
  -f, --filtering-patterns=<filteringPatterns>
